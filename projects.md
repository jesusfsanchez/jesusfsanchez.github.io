# Evaluation of Novel Scalable Swirl-Flame Hydrogen Combustor 
The use of hydrogen has attracted great interest due to its favorable combustion characteristics and increased concerns about the impact of hydrocarbon emissions on climate change. However, further research and development are needed before hydrogen can be widely adopted. This project investigates new hydrogen-air burner concepts suitable for stationary and aircraft gas turbine engines. The current burner design is capable of supporting up to 60% hydrogen dilution. Future work consists of developing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to study the flow and combustion reaction.
