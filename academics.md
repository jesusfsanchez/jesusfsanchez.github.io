# University of Southern California (USC)

I recently began my Master of Science in Astronautical Engineering at the University of Southern California, with a concentration in Spacecraft Propulsion. My coursework will include compressible flow, physical gas dynamics, combustion, liquid rocket propulsion, advanced spacecraft propulsion, space launch vehicle design, and orbital mechanics.

## California State University, Northridge (CSUN) 

I graduated from CSUN in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis in Aerospace Engineering. Relevant coursework I completed are: 
- Rocket Propulsion: Orbital mechanics, staging, heat transfer, nozzles, liquid & solid propulsion, and combustion 
- Aeropropulsion: Turbojets, ramjets, scramjets, cycle analysis, nozzles, compressors & turbines, and shock waves 
- Thermodynamics I & II: Power cycles, heat and refrigeration systems, chemically reacting mixtures 
- Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics: Controlled volume analysis, differential analysis, basic potential flows, boundary layer characteristics, and compressible flows 
- Heat Transfer: Conduction, convection, and radiation 
- Numerical Analysis of Engineering Systems: numerical methods covering linear and nonlinear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, regression and curve fitting, numerical differentiation, integration, and ordinary differential equations using MATLAB
- Computer-Aided Design and Analysis: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using SOLIDWORKS Simulation along with underlying theory 
- Mechanical Design I, II, III: CAD, machine design, and senior design project (see Projects)
