# Academic Part-Time Mechanical Engineer at NASA JPL
The [Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) is a leading NASA research center operating as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). JPL is renowned for its cutting-edge work in space exploration, planetary science, and technology development, playing a crucial role in NASAâ€™s most ambitious missions. 

I began my internship at JPL in May 2022 with the Electronic Packaging group where I played a key role in the [Mars Sample Return (MSR)](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-sample-return/) mission. I began by working on ground support equipment (GSE) and developing a tool capable of assembling sensitive electromechanical hardware for the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO). Subsequently, I led the design of an electromechanical unit for the Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL). As a lead designer, I oversaw the development of the system from prototype to engineering and flight models. 

I was responsible for generating CAD models using Siemens NX and designed for manufacturability and assembly (DFM & DFA). Using geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) I created engineering drawings such as assembly drawings, detailed part drawings, and interface-controlled drawings. I produced written instructions for build, assembly, and test to communicate with the fabrication team and collaborated closely to troubleshoot hardware build issues.
