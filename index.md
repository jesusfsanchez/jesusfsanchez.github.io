I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing a Master of Science in Astronautical Engineering. I am writing to apply for the Propulsion Development Engineer position at SpaceX. I hold a deep passion for the field of space exploration, specifically in the area of propulsion, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my leadership skills, space hardware design expertise, and analysis experience to your team. 


As an undergrad, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I played a key role in the Mars Sample Return mission. As a lead design engineer, I oversaw the development of electromechanical systems from prototype to flight models. I was responsible for generating CAD models, creating engineering drawings, designing for manufacturability and assembly, and collaborating closely with the production team to troubleshoot hardware build issues.
