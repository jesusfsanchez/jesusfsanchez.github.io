Hiring Manager 
SpaceX 
1 Rocket Rd 
Hawthorne, CA 90250 

Dear Hiring Manager, 

I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing a Master of Science in Astronautical Engineering. I am writing to apply for the Propulsion Development Engineer position at SpaceX. I hold a deep passion for the field of space exploration, specifically in the area of propulsion, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my leadership skills, space hardware design expertise, and analysis experience to your team. 

As an undergrad, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I played a key role in the Mars Sample Return mission. As a lead design engineer, I oversaw the development of electromechanical systems from prototype to flight models. I was responsible for generating CAD models, creating engineering drawings, designing for manufacturability and assembly, and collaborating closely with the production team to troubleshoot hardware build issues.

In addition to my professional experience, I have been actively involved in research and student competitions. My research on developing a novel swirl-flame combustor for gas turbine engines has deepened my understanding of fluids, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Furthermore, through student competitions such as NASA MINDS and ASME Human Powered Vehicle, I have gained experience in mechanical design and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). These experiences, coupled with my new graduate coursework and previous studies in Rocket Propulsion, Fluid Dynamics, and Thermodynamics II, equip me with the analytical and technical skills needed to succeed as a Propulsion Development Engineer. 

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the extreme ownership it entailsâ€”not only of the Raptor engines but also as part of the broader Starship mission to send humans to Mars. I am confident that my background, skills, and passion align perfectly with the demands of this position, and I am eager to contribute to SpaceX's mission of pushing the boundaries of space exploration.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you and can be reached at (805)815-7654 and sanchjesus24@gmail.com. 

Sincerely, 
Jesus Sanchez
