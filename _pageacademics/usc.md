I recently began my Master of Science in Astronautical Engineering at the University of Southern California, with a concentration in Spacecraft Propulsion. My coursework will include compressible flow, physical gas dynamics, combustion, liquid rocket propulsion, advanced spacecraft propulsion, space launch vehicle design, and orbital mechanics.
